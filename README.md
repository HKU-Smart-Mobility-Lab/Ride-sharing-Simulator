# Ride-sharing-Simulator
A high-capacity ride-sharing simulator calibrated by real request datasets and road netwoeks

## Updating...
- [x] Implement dispatching and repositioning algorithms of ride-sharing and ride-sourcing
- [x] Add traffic flow models to measure traffic congestion, speed, and carbon emissions
- [x] Implement 2D visualization
- [ ] Provide implementation for Reinforcement Learning algorithms
- [ ] Provide implementation for car-following models
- [ ] Provide implementation for high realistic 3D visualization
